# Computer-Architecture
Computer Architecture Notes

A solid, detailed understanding of how computers are designed and implemented, including the central processor and memory and I/O interfaces; and to make you aware of the numerous tradeoffs in design and implementation, their interaction, their realization in both historical and state-of-the-art systems, and trends that will affect them in future systems. We will cover instruction set architectures, pipelining (including basic pipelining, multiple-instruction-per-cycle machines, out-of-order instruction execution, and vector processing), memory systems (including caches and virtual memory), I/O interfaces, operating system issues, power utilization, and multiprocessor systems. We will also do case studies on microprocessors and systems you may have used, perhaps including the P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III), Pentium 4, AMD's Hammer, and the Itanium.
