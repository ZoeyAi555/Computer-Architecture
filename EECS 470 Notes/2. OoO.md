# Anatomy of OoO
1. Instruction Buffer
- basically: a bunch of latches for holding insns
2. Dispatch and issue
- Dispatch(D):first part of decode
    - allocate slots in insn buffer **inorder**
- Issuse(S):second part of decode
    - send insns from buffer to execution units **out of order**

# Dynamic Scheduling Algorithms
Register scheduler:scheduler driven by register ependences
- RAW: read after write
- WAW :write after write
- WAR: write after read

# Register renaming approach
every time an architected register is written we assign it to a physical register: **maptable**: r1->p1 r2->p2 r3->p3  
**rat**:register allocate table
